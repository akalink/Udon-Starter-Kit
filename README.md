**Requirements:**
[UdonSharp](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp),  [VRChat Udon SDK](https://vrchat.com/home/download)

Udon Starter Kit is a series of assets I have developed to get the beginner world developer started without the need to start learning how to use Udon right out the gate. As they progress they will be able to intergrate the code from this package with their own custom scripts. On top of udon script and prefabs, there is also an assortment of shaders and editor scripts. While built for beginners, developers of all skill levels will find some value from this package.
